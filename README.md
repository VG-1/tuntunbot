# tuntunbot
## Inspiration
We wanted to make a bot which can give output in the form of gifs but eventually we weren't able to do that but yeah the bot can reply for some specific command.

## What it does
TunTunBot replies when you will enter text like "hey", "hello",  "today", "time" and we are working on integrating dialogue flow and twilio in future.
## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS and JS 
## Challenges we ran into
We faces issues while getting a domain for it as well as faced issues while using dialogue flow and integrating it with twilio.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Atleast we have submitted something :)
## What we learned
It's better to build something and submit it and rather than sitting idle.
## What's next for TunTunBot
1. Integration of DialogueFlow and Twilio.
2. Domain name for it.
